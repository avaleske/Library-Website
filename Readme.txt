This was a project that Katherine Maack and I did for our 275 class. We had to design the database schema using mysql, and then write a php website that used it.

We started with the HTML5 Boilerplate, and went from there. We separated the rendering code from the logic code, by placing the logic in the *_behind.php files. Since we wrote by staying up all night over two nights, very hurriedly, the code is more spaghetti-like than I'd prefer, and I've not gone back to clean it up.

If I were to do this again, it'd be more organized and I'd be more proactive about keeping the dependencies managable. As it is, we realized we had code for rendering tables of books in one file, and wanted to use it elsewhere, so instead of pulling it into a util file we just included the origin file. Like I said, spaghetti.

So all that said, I'm actually still kind of proud of this, since we started not knowing what we were doing.

Library Website
Austin Valeske

This was a project that Katherine Maack and I did for our Databases class. We had to design the database schema using MySQL and then write a PHP website that used it.

We started with the HTML5 Boilerplate and went from there. We separated the rendering code from the logic code by placing the logic in the *_behind.php files. Since we wrote the site by staying up all night over two nights, very hurriedly, the code is more spaghetti-like than I'd prefer and I've not gone back to clean it up.

If I were to do this again it'd be more organized and I'd be more proactive about keeping the dependencies managable. For example, we realized we had code for rendering tables of books in one file, and wanted to use it elsewhere, so instead of pulling it into a util file we just included the original file in that page. Like I said, spaghetti.

So, all that said, I'm actually still kind of proud of this. We started not knowing what we were doing and ended up with one of the better looking and most functional projects in the class.
